Government Land Information System (GLIS) is a platform designed to organize, manage, and provide information related to government-owned land, encompassing details on ownership, land use, and regulatory data.

This project aims to deliver a geo-spatial analytic tool that can be used by government agencies, policymakers, environmentalist, students/researchers to analyze and derive meaningful insights from geospatial data. 

This website contains two major products - 
1. A Series of Web-Based interactive Dashboards
   a. Harnesses the potential of GLIS data to provide actionable insights and analyze demographic trends. 
   b. Geospatial Web based Interactive Map
   c. Information Interactive Dashboard
   d. Data shown with the use of various layers
2. Decision support system/ Recommender system using Machine Learning integrated in the dashboard
   a. Population Density Analysis 
   b. Infrastructure Location Prediction to find the optimal location as per the requirements of user. 
   c. Land Records Digitization that reduces land disputes, streamlines transactions, ensures transparency, and supports efficient land management and taxation. (Building Detection, Road Detection)
   d. Land use types classification using Deep Learning based semantic segmentation techniques using high-resolution satellite imagery
